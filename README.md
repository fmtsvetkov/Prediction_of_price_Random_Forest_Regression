# Prediction_of_price_Random_Forest_Regression
Prediction of price using Random forest Regression with given data set
In this project I had to predict price of flats from berlin_airbnb_test.csv. 
Input data was:
* berlin_airbnb_train.csv
* submit.csv 

My output had to be:
* my_submission.csv
* ipynb file

In ipynb file I had to compare different types of ML models and show lever of accuracy in predictions.

I used GaussianNB and Random Forest Regression with accuracy 0.0046 and 0.73 using closed testing data.
